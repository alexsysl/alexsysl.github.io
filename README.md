## Cygwin Setup

Don't have the privileges to install Ubuntu subsystem on your Windows computer at work but can't give up Bash?

Download <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe"> Cygwin </a>

Select 'lynx' package during setup.  

After installation run Cygwin and apply following commands in order to install commandline installer for Cygwin:

`lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg`

`install apt-cyg /bin`

Usage is same as apt-get:
`apt-cyg install nano` 

## Look for a file/folder in Linux machine

`sudo find / | grep <string>`

## Shutdown Linux Machine

`sudo shutdown -h now`
